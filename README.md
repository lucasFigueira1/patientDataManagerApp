## Architecture and Decisions
I've decided to structure the project with clean arquitecture and athomic thinking.
I am focusing on a good separation of concerns, clean code, good Form handling and clear types.
I've also opted to keep the "app" folder for navigation related files, while placing the rest of the code in the "src" folder.
